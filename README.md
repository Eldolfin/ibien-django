<h1>iBien Website</h1> 

<p><em>iBien</em> is a personal project that I developed using <strong>Django</strong>, and it allowed me to learn a lot about implementing <strong>CRUD</strong> functionalities in a web application. The purpose of the application is to be a selling website similar to <strong>eBay</strong>, where users can add items, set their prices, and add a description and picture. Although the website has some limitations, such as the lack of security features and error handling, it provided me with a great learning experience.</p>

<p>The buying part of the website has not been implemented, and it only displays the <strong>10 most recently listed items</strong> on the home page. Users can also <strong>modify and delete</strong> their items by going to the "My items" tab.</p>

<p>Overall, the iBien website serves as a personal project that allowed me to gain hands-on experience in web development using <strong>Django</strong>.</p></div>

<p>The test file located in <i>my_app/tests.py</i>   contains several test cases for a web application. The tests are designed to check the behavior of various views, models, and forms. The <strong>test methodology</strong> used here involves setting up the necessary data and environment for each test case and then making assertions about the expected results. The tests cover scenarios such as checking if the view returns the correct HTTP status code, templates, and objects. The file estimates that the <strong>tests coverage is around 90%</strong>, which means that the majority of the application code is tested and verified to be working as expected. This test file allowed me to find a few bugs in my application, which I then corrected.</p>
