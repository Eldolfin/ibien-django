<h1>iBien Website</h1>
<p><em>iBien</em> is a personal project that I developed using <strong>Django</strong>, and it allowed me to learn a lot about implementing <strong>CRUD</strong> functionalities in a web application. The purpose of the application is to be a selling website similar to <strong>eBay</strong>, where users can add items, set their price, and add a description and picture. Although the website has some limitations, such as the lack of security features and error handling, it provided me with a great learning experience.</p><p>The buying part of the website has not been implemented, and it only displays the <strong>10 most recent listed items</strong> on the home page. Users can also <strong>modify and delete</strong> their items by going to the "My items" tab.</p><p>Overall, the iBien website serves as a personal project that allowed me to gain hands-on experience in web development using <strong>Django</strong>.</p></div>
